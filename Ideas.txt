Ideas for TPOT App:

**Views**
- Dashboard (Shift-like) - seamless switching between different views.
    + RTF editor - 
    + Html view - allows minor edits; launches in-view xor in-browser (via Process.Start()).
    + Wordpress view - edits/post to Wordpress
    + 

All views operate on the same dataset, which consists of the raw & edited (diffs) of RTF, Html, and wordpress.

***Considerations***
1. Use that special control you found that replaces RTFBox with something more like a full editor (starred in GitHub).




            <Button Name="btnConvert" Margin="5">
                        <!--  todo: delete when RTF viewmodel can be properly observed.  -->
                        Convert
                    </Button>
                    <Button Margin="5">Save</Button>
                    <Button Margin="5">Mark Ready</Button>
