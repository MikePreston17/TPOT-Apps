# TPOT Letters üìù


**An example of using create-react-app, electron, and file2html**.  
Original boilerplate made by [Kitze](https://twitter.com/thekitze) who works @ Medium. Read his ([article](https://medium.com/@kitze/%EF%B8%8F-from-react-to-an-electron-app-ready-for-production-a0468ecb1da3)). 

Adapted by Braden & Michael Preston to add more features like WordPress API, Google Drive API, converting `.docx` documents and automatic updates through the GitHub repository.

- [ ] WP API

## Getting Started üê´

1.) Clone this repository and cd into the directory, or "Open in GitHub Desktop"
```node
	git clone https://github.com/Braden-Preston/electron-react-combined
	
	cd electron-react-file2html
```

2.) Install yarn globally as a node module
```node
	npm i -g yarn
```
3.) Install app's dependancies. Creates /node-modules/ & package-lock.json
```node
	npm install
```
4.) Start a development environment for React for live code editing! üòµ
```node
	yarn start
```

## Developing the App üê≥

Yarn starts up a dev environment that waits on the react and electron components to compile. After that is done, it pushes an injection routine that allows for hot-editing the code live. 

The main render process, browser window is being hosted on `http://localhost:3000`, which allows you to dynamically update the code. Any time, you save a file, it should update the app. If it doesn't, you can always `ctrl`+`c` out of the batch process and restart the dev environment with your most recent code using `yarn start`.

## Making a Build üê£

```node
	yarn build
```
>  Note: Squirrel is NOT implemented yet; however, `electron-builder`  is, so it may be  easier to add later.

Executing this yarn script starts a build, which could take anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes to build. It creates two directories **build** and **dist**. If you have already created a build before, it may be best to clear out these two directories if they already exist. This way you don't end up with duplicate installers in the **dist** directory. It should be smart enough to override existing builds

> Note: Make super-certain you are bumping up the version number in **pacakge.json**. I believe there are pacakges that do this that can be implemented later to this boilerplate.
